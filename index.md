The IT University of Copenhagen organizes an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Oct. 24-29 (week 43).
<br><br>
The event will bring together local communities of people from academia and industry, both students and professionals that all share an interest in data visualization. During the IEEE VIS 2021 virtual event, we will meet at ITU to stream the virtual event together and to interact through associated local events.

## The Program

The satellite program will provide options for viewing the virtual IEEE VIS 2021 Program, 15.00-20.20 local time (CEST).

We provide a fully catered event with free registration.

Please check back shortly for more information about the virtual program viewing options at our event.

### The Local Program

In addition to the virtual program, the satellite program provides several opportunities to attend local events and to interact with other attendees. These are coordinated with the virtual program and directly preceed it. The local events will build connections between local communities that share an interest in visualization and highlight the work going on in the greater Copenhagen area that relate to and offer opportunies for exciting visualization work.

We currently work on the following local events (*cursive* are uncertain):

| Day | Event | Time slot | Room |

Make sure to also check out the virtual program at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/). We will add details about room allocation for the virtual tracks at the conference over the next days.

# Attending

The satellite event takes place in beatiful Copenhagen, which offers a vibrant restaurant and bar scene and great cultural expriences, for example, at the city's many museums or simply when walking among the many historic buildings — the city is known for being very walkable.

{% include gallery id="galleryfood" caption="Enjoy the vibrant restaurant and bar scene in Copenhagen." %}

ITU is located next to the 800-meter Emil Holms Kanal in the northeastern part of Ørestad between Copenhagen and DR Byen – home of the National Danish Broadcast Service (Danmarks Radio).

### Travels and accomodation

We have several hotels within walking distance to the satellite venue:

* [Zoku Copenhagen](https://livezoku.com/copenhagen/)
* [Radisson Blu Copenhagen](https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-blu-copenhagen-scandinavia)
* [Bryggen Guldsmeden](https://guldsmedenhotels.com/bryggen/)

Many more are still within easy reach of the satellite venue by walking, biking, or via metro.

### Registration

Please register for the event at [https://vis21cph.eventbrite.dk](https://vis21cph.eventbrite.dk). Upon registration, we will add you to our mailing list where we communicate updates and information about the event.
