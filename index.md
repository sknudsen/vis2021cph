The IT University of Copenhagen organizes an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Oct. 24-29 (week 43).
<br><br>
The event will bring together local communities of people from academia and industry, both students and professionals that all share an interest in data visualization. During the IEEE VIS 2021 virtual event, we will meet at ITU to stream the virtual event together and to interact through associated local events.

## The Local and Virtual Program

The satellite program provides options for viewing the virtual IEEE VIS 2021 Program, 15.00-20.30 local time (CEST).

In addition to the virtual program, the satellite program provides several opportunities to attend local events and to interact with other attendees. These are coordinated with the virtual program and directly precede it. The local events aim to build connections between local communities that share an interest in visualization and highlight the work going on in the greater Copenhagen area that relate to and offer opportunities for exciting visualization work.

We provide a high-level overview below. For details and room allocation for the virtual tracks, please refer to [our program](./program). Make sure to also check out the virtual program at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/).
