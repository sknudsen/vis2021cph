# Welcome to Copenhagen IEEE VIS 2021 at ITU

The IT University of Copenhagen is organizing an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Oct. 24-29 (week 43).

The event will bring together local communities of people from academia and industry, both students and professionals that all share an interest in data visualization. During the IEEE VIS 2021 virtual event, they will meet at ITU to stream the virtual event together and to interact through associated local events.

## The Program

The satellite program will provide options for viewing the virtual IEEE VIS 2021 Program, 15.00-20.20 local time (CEST). 

Please check back shortly for more information about the virtual program viewing options at our event.

### The Local Program

In addition to the virtual program, the satellite program will provide several opportunities to attend local events and to interact with other attendees. We expect these to be coordinated with the virtual program and directly preceed it. For example, half-day workshops (12.00-14.45) and full-day workshops (9.00-14.45). The local events will build connections between local communities that share an interest in visualization and highlight the work going on in the greater Copenhagen area that relate to and offer opportunies for exciting visualization work.

Currently in the works are:
* Visualization in Practice community meetup (Monday)
* Design workshop (Tuesday)
* Local Keynote (Wednesday)
* Poster session (Wednesday)
* Workshop on eXplainable AI (Wednesday)
* Workshop on Network Visualization (Thursday)
* Workshop on Healthcare Data  (Friday)

Please check back later for more details about local program. If you would like to organize an event at our satellite, please reach out to us. 

In the meantime, check the virtual program at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/).
