Articificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support decision-making or for automation. However, the technologies involved are often experienced as black boxes — the decisions made are rarely clear or transparent. Providing explanations to allow stakeholders to understand AI has thus become a societal concern. In response, the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) considers technical appproaches to help people better understand the processes involved in automated decision-making and the results emerging from them. Thus, XAI promises to help open the _black box_ of AI.

In this workshop, we invite participants to share their perspectives on Healthcare Data and Visual Representations of Data.

# Program

The workshop is scheduled for the morning and early afternoon of Friday October 29, 2021 at ITU. We organize the workshop in three parts. 

## 9.30-10.30: Welcome and introduction by participants

In the first part of the workshop, participants briefly introduce themselves, their work in relation to XAI and data visualization, and their motivation for participating in the workshop (up to three minutes per participant) . 

Slides are optional, but need to be shared with the organisers as pdf 24 hours prior to the workshop (contact information below). 

_We will post the participant list and slides here as they are shared with us_

## 11.00-12.00: Group forming and discussions

In the second part, we group up acccording to themes emerging from the introductions, in terms of interests and perspectives. Themes can be anything from shared interest in a specific aspect of healthcare data, formulating concrete research questions, or potential collaborations around this topic. Workshop participants work on the individual themes in groups.

## 12.00-13.00: _Lunch Break_

## 13.00-14.30: Group discussions and sharing
We continue our work in groups in the the third part of the workshop and reconvene at 14.00 to share the results of the group work and discussions with the other workshop participants.
