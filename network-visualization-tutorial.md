Networks are ubiquitously identified with a set of nodes carefully organized in a space and connected by line links. This happens regardless the fact that nodes and links are just one of the many ways we have available to represent vertices and edges in networks. In few other areas has the object of study and its visual representation been so deeply intertwined as with network analysis and network visualization, to the point where the difference between the two is often fading away. 

The tutorial is scheduled for the morning of Thursday October 28, 2021 at ITU.

## 9.00-12.00: Visual exploration of networks and network data

Starting from his experience developing the network visualization tool Gephi, Mathieu Jacomy will present the possibilities and the epistemological consequences of visual exploration of network data. 

He will give a few technical landmarks to ensure that everyone has the basics covered, and from there move to more interesting stuff about interpreting visualizations and exploring data. 

Based on participants experience and the turnout, Mathieu Jacomy will slowly move from technical questions to more epistemic questions.
