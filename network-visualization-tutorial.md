Networks ubiquitously identified with a set of nodes carefully organized in a space and connected by edges. This happens regardless the fact that  nodes and edges are just one of the many ways we have available to represent networks. In few other cases the object of study and its visual representation have been so deeply intertwined with the difference between network analysis and network visualization often fading away. 

The vis21cph workshop on network visualization will explore the possibilities, open challenges and limits of the current approach to network visualization. 

# Program

The Network Visualization Workshop is organized in two parts: 

## 9.00-12.00: Visual exploration of networks and network data
Starting from his experience developing the network visualization software Gephi, Mathieu Jacomy will present the possibilities and the epistemological consequences of visual exploration of network data. 

*Location: ITU - Room information TBD*

## 13.00-14.35: Roundtable: Network Visualization beyond nodes and edges
During the second part of the workshop, a three-person panel will initiate a discussion on the limits and possibilities of network visualization when dealing with more complex network models such as temporal networks, multilayer networks, and multipartite networks. 

### Panel
We are happy to be joined by a set of awesome panel members:
