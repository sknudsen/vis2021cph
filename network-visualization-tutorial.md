Networks are ubiquitously identified with a set of nodes carefully organized in a space and connected by line links. This happens regardless of the fact that nodes and links are just one of the many ways we have available to represent vertices and edges in networks. In few other areas has the object of study and its visual representation been so deeply intertwined as with network analysis and network visualization, to the point where the difference between the two is often fading away.

The tutorial is given by Mathieu Jacomy. Mathieu is part of the core Gephi team and initiated the Gephi network analysis software, notably through algorithms like ForceAtlas2. When not working on Gephi, he develops other digital tools for the social sciences and provides support and advice in digital methods to scholars. He investigates how digital knowledge technologies transform our relation to complex phenomena. His current research focuses on visual network analysis and exploration, issue mapping, developing tools for digital methods and reflecting on methodological aspects. 

The tutorial is scheduled for the morning of Thursday October 28, 2021 at ITU.

## How to attend

If you would like to attend the tutorial, please register for the satellite conference (link to Eventbrite from the main page). During registration, you will get the chance to add a ticket for our workshop. If you already registered, you can still add workshop attendance.

# Program

The tutorial is scheduled for the morning of Thursday October 28, 2021 at ITU.

## 9.00-12.00: Visual exploration of networks and network data

Starting from his experience developing the network visualization tool Gephi, Mathieu Jacomy will present the possibilities and the epistemological consequences of visual exploration of network data. 

He will give a few technical landmarks to ensure that everyone has the basics covered, and from there move to more interesting stuff about interpreting visualizations and exploring data. 

Based on participants experience and the turnout, Mathieu Jacomy will slowly move from technical questions to more epistemic questions.
