Articificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support decision-making or for automation. However, the technologies involved are often experienced as black boxes — the decisions made are rarely clear or transparent. Providing explanations to allow stakeholders to understand AI has thus become a societal concern. In response, the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) considers technical appproaches to help people better understand the processes involved in automated decision-making and the results emerging from them. Thus, XAI promises to help open the _black box_ of AI.

In this workshop, we invite participants to share their perspectives on XAI and data visualization.

The tutorial is scheduled for the morning of Wednesday October 27, 2021 at ITU.
