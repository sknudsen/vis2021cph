Networks ubiquitously identified with a set of nodes carefully organized in a space and connected by edges. This happens regardless the fact that  nodes and edges are just one of the many ways we have available to represent networks. In few other cases the object of study and its visual representation have been so deeply intertwined with the difference between network analysis and network visualization often fading away. The VIS21CPH workshop on network visualization will explore the possibilities, open challenges and limits of the current approach to network visualization. 

The workshop is organized in two moments: 

<u>9-12: Visual exploration of networks and network data.</u> 
Starting from his experience developing the network visualization software Gephi, Mathieu Jacomy will present the possibilities and the epistemological consequences of visual exploration of network data. 

<u>13-14.35: Roundtable: Network Visualization beyond nodes and edges.</u>
Mathieu Jacomy - Ã…lborg University, Matteo Magnani - Uppsala University and Michele Coscia - IT University of Copenhagen will discuss on the limits and possibilities of network visualization when dealing with more complex network models such as temporal networks, multilayer networks, multipartite networks.
