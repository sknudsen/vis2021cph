## How to attend

If you would like to attend our workshop, please register for the satellite conference (link to Eventbrite from the main page). During registration, you will get the chance to add a ticket for our workshop. If you already registered, you can still add workshop attendance.

**Location**: ITU, _room tbd_

**Date**: Tuesday October 26, 2021

**Time**: 10.00-14.30

# Program

The workshop is scheduled for the morning and early afternoon of Tuesday October 26, 2021 at ITU. We organize the workshop in two parts. 

## 10.00-12.00: Observe! Collect! Draw!

**10.00-10.10:** Welcome

**10.10-11.50:** Observe! Collect! Draw!

**11.50-12.00:** Conclusion and introduction to second half of program and poll

## 12.00-13.00: _Lunch Break_

## 13.00-14.30: Design activity from VIS 2021 Workshop on Data Vis Activities
The [IEEE VIS 2021 Workshop on Data Vis Activities](https://visactivities.github.io/) is happening Monday evening of the conference — the day prior to our design workshop. During this workshop, different authors will present *Visualisation Activities to Facilitate Learning, Reflecting, Discussing, and Designing*. Based on the contributions there, we will create a poll for participants to our design workshop, which will ask participants to prioritise which of the activities they would like to do together. The poll will be introduced before the lunch break, allowing participants to answer during the break. 

The result of the poll will be available when we start the design activity. Thus, this will be a highly improvised activity that will ask everyone to work together to make it happen. I hope this will be a chance to have a bt of fun in an otherwise tightly packed conference week!

In the final half hour of the workshop, we share our thoughts and reflect on the activities we have done together in the workshop. If there is interest to provide feedback to the authors of the second activity (which was presented Monday evening of the conference in the Vis Activities workshop), we organize how we might collaborate over the next weeks on doing so. 

**13.00-14.00:** Design activity based on poll (highly improvised and informal)

**14.00-14.30:** Sharing and reflection
