We invite you to show off your work during a 90 minutes interactive session. You might demo visualization artifacts or projects that relate to data or visualization. You can also prepare a large format poster and display this as part of the session. During the session, you can discuss your work with other conference attendees. In case you haven’t come across a poster previously, they are large-format prints (usually A0 or A1) prepared for events such as this. If you want to demo interactive artifacts, you will need to bring your own device with you.

How do I sign up? For now, please let us know via email to soekn@itu.dk. We will follow up with more information soon.
