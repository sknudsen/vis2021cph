The digital age has profoundly changed the way we produce, share and use information. As the traditional intermediaries between editors and readers, designers of information have to establish a new balance between these forces. In doing so, they need to redefine their own position as well. Next to designing digital information environments, maps, information visualizations, typefaces and spatial installations Joost Grootens works primarily in the field of book design, acknowledging the growing need for visual representation of data. The books he makes present knowledge, but they also question the relevance of typologies such as catalogues, indexes and atlases as part of an ongoing research process. Grootens likes to deal with complexity, showing that it is a misconception to assume that something complex should look complicated. 

## Biography

His studio SJG designs books, maps, typefaces, spatial installations and digital information environments for publishers like Lars Müller Publishers, nai010 publishers, Phaidon press, educational and research institutes like ETH Zürich, Future Cities Laboratory Singapore, TU Munich, and museums like Astrup Fearnly Museet Oslo, Serpentine Galleries London, Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven. SJG won numerous prizes for their designs. Among them the Golden Letter and two gold medals in the Best Book Design from all over the World competition, and twice the Dutch Design Award for Graphic Design.

Grootens studied architectural design at Gerrit Rietveld Academy Amsterdam and obtained his doctorate at Leiden University. A public edition of his dissertation Blind Maps and Blue Dots: The Blurring of the Producer-User Divide in the Production of Visual Information was published by Lars Müller Publishers in 2021. Grootens’ research addresses the transformation of the fields and practices of graphic design and mapmaking resulting from technological changes in tools to record, create, edit, produce and disseminate visual information.The IT University of Copenhagen organizes an [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/) 2021 [satellite event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/call-participation/satellite) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Oct. 24-29 (week 43).
