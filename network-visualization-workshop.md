Networks ubiquitously identified with a set of nodes carefully organized in a space and connected by edges. This happens regardless the fact that  nodes and edges are just one of the many ways we have available to represent networks. In few other cases the object of study and its visual representation have been so deeply intertwined with the difference between network analysis and network visualization often fading away. 

The vis21cph workshop on network visualization will explore the possibilities, open challenges and limits of the current approach to network visualization. 

# Program

We organize the Network Visualization Workshop in two parts. 

## 13.00-13.45: Introduction by workshop participants

In the first part of the workshop, a participants briefly introduce themselves, their work in relation to network visualization, and their motivation for participating in the workshop (up to three minutes per participant) . 

Slides are optional, but need to be shared with the organisers as pdf 24 hours prior to the workshop. 

_We will post the participant list and slides here as they are shared with us_

## Roundtable: Network Visualization beyond nodes and edges

In the second part of the workshop, a three-person panel initiate a discussion on the limits and possibilities of network visualization when dealing with more complex network models such as temporal networks, multilayer networks, and multipartite networks. 

We are happy to be joined by a set of awesome panel members:
* Mathieu Jacomy - Aalborg University
* Matteo Magnani - Uppsala University
* Michele Coscia - IT University of Copenhagen

*Location: ITU - Room information TBD*
